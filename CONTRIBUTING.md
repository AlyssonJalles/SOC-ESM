## How to Contribute

   Open an issue with a clear description of the bug or idea.
2. **Contribute Code** :

   * Fork the repo and create a branch.
   * To contribute to the codebase, open a pull request on the **Pull Request**.
   * Open a pull request referencing any related issues (e.g.,`Fixes #N`).
   * Ensure the code follows PEP 8, includes tests, and is well-documented.

## Guidelines

* Keep pull requests focused on a single issue.
* Ensure existing tests pass and new functionality is tested.


## I'm a maintainer, should I make pull requests too?
Yes. Nobody should ever push to master directly. All changes should be made through a pull request.
